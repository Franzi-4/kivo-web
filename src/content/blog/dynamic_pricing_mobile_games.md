### Pros

## Subscription Model

### What It Is
The **[subscription model](https://setupad.com/blog/game-monetization-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** charges players a recurring fee for premium access, ad-free play, or exclusive content.

### Cons

- Adapts to evolving market and player behavior.

### Cons
