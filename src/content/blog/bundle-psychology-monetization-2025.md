## The Psychology Behind Effective Bundles

### Cognitive Biases That Drive Sales
- **Anchoring Effect**: Show a premium-priced bundle first, making mid-tier offers look like bargains.  
- **Loss Aversion**: Time-limited bundles (24–48 hrs) and “last chance” messaging boost urgency.  
- **Choice Architecture**: Offer 3 tiers (good, better, best), highlighting the middle as “best value.”

4. **Retention Lock-In (Sustain)** – Subscription or battle pass.  

### Smart Offer Timing
- Tutorial completion → Entry offer.  
- First difficulty spike → Value demonstration.  
- Content unlocks → Premium stage.
